# Use Case 4: Cost-Optimized Data Warehouse Migration

![Cost Optimization Workflow](workflow.svg)

## Business Scenario

**Company**: EnterpriseData Ltd  
**Challenge**: Migrate from expensive traditional data warehouse to cost-effective lakehouse while maintaining performance and governance.

**Key Players**:
- **Robert Chen** (CFO) - Driving 40% cost reduction mandate across IT infrastructure
- **Dr. Patricia Williams** (Chief Data Officer) - Ensuring data governance and compliance during migration
- **Kevin Martinez** (Enterprise Architect) - Designing scalable lakehouse architecture
- **Angela Thompson** (BI Director) - Maintaining business continuity during migration

### The Traditional Data Warehouse Cost Crisis

**Day 1 - The Financial Reality Check**:
```
Robert:   "Our Teradata costs are $2.1M annually and growing 25% per year - unsustainable!"
Patricia: "We can't compromise on governance, security, or compliance during any migration"
Kevin:    "Legacy ETL processes are rigid and expensive to maintain - $180K per engineer"
Angela:   "Business users need seamless transition - no disruption to existing reports"
```

**Traditional Data Warehouse Cost Breakdown**:
- **Software Licenses**: $1.2M annually (60% of total cost)
- **Hardware/Infrastructure**: $480K annually (24% of total cost)
- **Maintenance & Support**: $240K annually (12% of total cost)
- **Professional Services**: $180K annually (4% of total cost)
- **Total Annual Cost**: $2.1M with 25% yearly growth

### Dremio Lakehouse Migration Strategy

**Phase 1 - Assessment and Planning (Month 1)**:
```sql
-- Analyze current data warehouse usage patterns
WITH usage_analysis AS (
  SELECT 
    schema_name,
    table_name,
    AVG(daily_queries) as avg_daily_queries,
    SUM(storage_gb) as total_storage_gb,
    MAX(last_access_date) as last_accessed,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users
  FROM teradata_usage_logs
  WHERE log_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 90 DAY
  GROUP BY schema_name, table_name
),
migration_priority AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    CASE 
      WHEN avg_daily_queries >= 100 AND active_users >= 10 THEN 'HIGH_PRIORITY'
      WHEN avg_daily_queries >= 10 OR active_users >= 5 THEN 'MEDIUM_PRIORITY'
      WHEN last_accessed >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 30 DAY THEN 'LOW_PRIORITY'
      ELSE 'ARCHIVE_CANDIDATE'
    END as migration_priority,
    
    -- Cost analysis
    (total_storage_gb * 0.85) as monthly_teradata_cost,  -- $0.85/GB/month
    (total_storage_gb * 0.023) as monthly_s3_cost       -- $0.023/GB/month
  FROM usage_analysis
)
SELECT 
  migration_priority,
  COUNT(*) as table_count,
  SUM(total_storage_gb) as total_storage_gb,
  SUM(monthly_teradata_cost) as current_monthly_cost,
  SUM(monthly_s3_cost) as target_monthly_cost,
  (SUM(monthly_teradata_cost) - SUM(monthly_s3_cost)) / SUM(monthly_teradata_cost) as cost_savings_pct
FROM migration_priority
GROUP BY migration_priority
ORDER BY cost_savings_pct DESC;
```

**Phase 2 - Pilot Migration (Months 2-3)**:
```bash
# Set up Dremio lakehouse environment
# Connect to existing Teradata for gradual migration
curl -X POST http://dremio-coordinator:9047/apiv2/source \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "teradata_legacy",
    "type": "TERADATA",
    "config": {
      "hostname": "teradata-prod.enterprise.com",
      "port": 1025,
      "database": "PROD_DW",
      "username": "dremio_migration"
    }
  }'

# Configure S3 as primary data lake storage
curl -X POST http://dremio-coordinator:9047/apiv2/source \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "enterprise_datalake",
    "type": "S3",
    "config": {
      "credentialType": "AWS_PROFILE",
      "buckets": ["enterprise-data-lake"],

## Migration Implementation

**Phase 3 - Full Migration (Months 4-8)**:
```sql
-- Create federated views for seamless transition
CREATE VDS customer_analytics_unified AS
SELECT 
  -- Migrated data from S3
  c.customer_id,
  c.customer_name,
  c.registration_date,
  c.customer_tier,
  
  -- Legacy data still in Teradata (during transition)
  t.total_lifetime_value,
  t.last_purchase_date,
  t.risk_score,
  
  -- Derived metrics combining both sources
  DATEDIFF('day', c.registration_date, CURRENT_DATE) as customer_age_days,
  CASE 
    WHEN t.total_lifetime_value > 10000 AND c.customer_tier = 'PREMIUM' THEN 'HIGH_VALUE'
    WHEN t.total_lifetime_value > 5000 OR c.customer_tier IN ('GOLD', 'PREMIUM') THEN 'MEDIUM_VALUE'
    ELSE 'STANDARD'
  END as unified_segment

FROM enterprise_datalake.customers.profiles c
LEFT JOIN teradata_legacy.customer_metrics t 
  ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id;

-- Performance optimization with reflections
ALTER TABLE customer_analytics_unified
CREATE REFLECTION customer_summary_agg
USING DIMENSIONS (
  customer_tier,
  unified_segment, 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', registration_date) as reg_month
)
MEASURES (
  COUNT(*) as customer_count,
  AVG(total_lifetime_value) as avg_ltv,
  SUM(total_lifetime_value) as total_ltv
);
```

-- Total Savings: $5.47M (66% cost reduction)
-- Payback Period: 14 months
```

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **Phased Migration Approach**: Minimized risk with gradual data migration
2. **Federated Query Capability**: Enabled seamless transition without disruption  
3. **Performance Optimization**: Reflections provided better performance than original DW
4. **Cost Transparency**: Detailed cost tracking validated projected savings
5. **Change Management**: Comprehensive training ensured user adoption

**Lessons Learned**:
- **Data Quality**: 3% of legacy data required cleansing before migration
- **Query Optimization**: 15% of queries needed rewriting for optimal performance
- **User Training**: 2 weeks of training reduced support tickets by 80%
- **Governance**: Automated lineage tracking simplified compliance reporting
- **Monitoring**: Real-time cost tracking enabled ongoing optimization

The migration to Dremio's lakehouse architecture delivered on all key objectives: 66% cost reduction, improved performance, maintained governance, and positioned EnterpriseData Ltd for scalable growth while dramatically reducing their total cost of ownership.
